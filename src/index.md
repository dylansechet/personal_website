about: |
  Hi! I am a PhD student working in the [A&O team](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/research/research-departments/algorithms-learning-and-computation/learning-and-optimization/?lang=en) at [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/), under the supervision of [Matthieu Kowalski](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/mkowalski)
  and [Marc Evrard](https://marcevrard.github.io/).
  Previously, I was working as a research engineer on M/EEG inverse problems. 

  I received my Master's degree from CentraleSupélec.

research: |
  My work focuses on building lightweight and explainable neural network for music source separation.
  I'm exploring topics such as unrolling, time-frequency decompositions and matrix decompositions.
